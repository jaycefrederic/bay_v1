# i have made this way too complicated

# here are my notes:

# for platforms:
    # don't need to def anything but init
    # worry bout handling collisions when u get to moving plats and see how it goes
    
    def handle_collision(self, player):
            #lands the player on top of the platform
            player.rect.bottom = self.rect.top
            player.on_ground = True
            if issubclass(self, MovingPlatform) or issubclass(self, SlowPlatform) or issubclass(self, BouncyPlatform):
                self.passenger = player
        
    def check_collision(self, player):  # sourcery skip: use-named-expression
        if self.rect.colliderect(player.rect):
            #what part of player is touching the platform?
            collision_side = self.rect.collidepoint(player.rect.midbottom)
            if collision_side:
                self.handle_collision(player)
            elif player.rect.colliderect(self.rect):
                self.handle_collision(player)
                
                
                
    i will need to make a new class for each type of platform

    i will conquer this beast tomorrow
