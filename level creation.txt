(910, 500) [bounce] 			...
(1010, 400) 				much of it belonged to me

LEVEL 02/the road not taken, written by robert frost
---
oh yes. i know this one well.
i memorized it in the third grade, i think.
it taught me a valuable lesson:
my decisions do not matter.
i will end where i end.
every choice is the right one.
...
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

LEVEL 03/gardening was never my forte but i can't even get the dirt to flourish
---
i want to tell you that the silence is unnerving
that i think maybe it's just
contained inside my head, that when
i stop breathing i can feel the air conditioner
and dishes clinking in the kitchen but sometimes

i wonder if i closed my eyes and
dropped a penny off the empire state building would
i be a murderer?
or would the wind carry it far enough
that the anchorwoman would announce
saturday evening at 6:45 an elderly man wearing
a trenchcoat passed away in a freak accident
involving a copper lincoln that
meteorologists believe may have been
trapped in a stormcloud

when i was 11 i used to pull weeds in the garden with
my mom and i remember she told me that if
you want to make room for flowers to grow you have to
really get rid of the weeds and well
i guess i never pulled hard enough because
i haven't had a garden in me for years but i'm
starting to believe that dandelions are
just fine and not everyone needs roses

followed by a suicide note, written by the anonymous kpk

The calm,
Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss

i had meant to go to bed
but somehow fell into the sea
the waves cradled me in
and rocked me gently to sleep

LEVEL 05/goodnight
---
g oose egg remnants of misadventure

LEVEL 06/6.22.15
---
a year after the monster behind his eyes
ceased to exist he soaked his clothes with apologies
and I started spending nights cold sweat shivering naked
in my closet I dreampt that without clothes I would be invisible,
had nightmares that he found me anyway.
you cannot hide from the past.
it is blood-soaked, wrought-iron fingers
that will always find their way into your
fragile picket-fence ribcage,
picking apart your carefully constructed present tense
brick by dollar-store-lego-set brick.
you did the best you could.

LEVEL 07/wild geese, written by mary oliver
---
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.

LEVEL 08/magnets
---
I let a happy girl
drink rivers of blue
she was so innocent
and you ate her up

you tore her open
for your friends
why did you ever think
to trust them with the universe?
if you are looking for peace,
i hope you find it safely



in time I will bloom a
thousand star smile even though
I could never be a flower
in their night light sky



I was your delicious western mystery
with the world in my hellos
you were my white vans
weathered with wine
I am no lover.

LEVEL 09/5.19.15

watching yourself go is like watching
the house you built out of legos deconstruct,
one small piece at a time.
You saw your friends go through this, they're better now.
You wait your turn, wait your turn, wait you turn
you come home to find your mother crying in your room
holding your baby pictures, she says quietly:
"this is not what i envisioned when i found out i was pregnant"
you cannot stand seeing her like this,
you wait your turn.
in and out of hospitals and institutions,
your illness steals your youth away from you.
you feel more like a weight than a person,
but shouldn't lifting offer strength?
some days your foot is so heavy that
you meant to take exit 17 but you're 30 miles out
and swerving in and out of traffic is all you can
manage at ninety miles per hour, ninety-one, ninety-two,
ninety-three. you never get pulled over.
how many times have you been honked at because the
light changed but you were too far gone to hit the gas?
it wasn't always like this.
once upon a time you were going to make it.
when they ask you why you did it,
tell them how nothing in particular pushed you over the edge
bits of you fell away, one by one by one until there was
simply not enough of you left.

LEVEL 10/next time, written by Mary Oliver
---
Next time what I'd do is look at
the earth before saying anything. I'd stop
just before going into a house
and be an emperor for a minute
and listen better to the wind
      or to the air being still.

When anyone talked to me, whether
blame or praise or just passing time,
I'd watch the face, how the mouth
has to work, and see any strain, any
sign of what lifted the voice.

And for all, I'd know more -- the earth
bracing itself and soaring, the air
finding every leaf and feather over
forest and water, and for every person
the body glowing inside the clothes
    like a light.
